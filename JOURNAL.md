## 10/26/2025 - Plan on whats needed  

I have started researching how an Ionic wind thruster work and what would be needed to execute this project. I've understood what is needed mainly through youtube videos and articles. I am also planning on meeting up with my physics teacher at school as his knowledge on ionic thrusters could very much assist me as I have no chemistry knowledge :)

What I need:

- Nickel strip
- High voltage generator
- Metal round ring
- Copper sulfate
- Copper metal sheet 
- Graphite spray
- Lithium Ion Battery
- 3D printed parts (design)
- Switch

I shall order the parts that I don't have now! And then begin working on it ![71wP2xR5aIL._AC_AA360_](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTU4NiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--3589f39e253d4d8652e011f3b62476f21e5173ec/71wP2xR5aIL._AC_AA360_.jpg)
