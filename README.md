IONIC PLASMA THRUSTER:

I want to create an Ionic Plasma Thruster. This device is a high-voltage generator that ionises air. The ions then collide with and push surrounding air molecules, and these collisions create a breeze or thrust - known as ionic wind. I made this project because I think it is very cool to generate wind and movement of air molecules without anything physically moving, unlike a normal fan with propellers. I am also genuinely fascinated by electricity and how it works, which is why I decided to build this project.
