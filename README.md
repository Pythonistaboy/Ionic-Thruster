IONIC PLASMA THRUSTER:

I wish to create an Ionic Plasma Thruster. This is a high voltage generator, ionises air. The ions collide and push air molecules. The collision creates a breeze/thrust - ionic wind.
I made the project because personally I think it is very cool to create wind and movement of air molecules without anything phsycically moving such as propellers, like a normal 
fan would work. I am also just genuniley facinated by electricity and its ways hence I decided to create this project.
